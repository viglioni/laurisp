  More general config instructions about how to use my spacemacs repo, which this repo is a submodule of, you can find at [[https://github.com/Viglioni/spacemacs/blob/master/README.md][here]].

  Only ~functional~, ~core~ and ~config~ are loaded at start. All the other libs will be loaded as they are needed.

  The ~config~ files assume the existence of three private files not shown in this repo:
#+begin_src shell :exports both 
  ~/private-files/emacs-files/env-private.el
  ~/private-files/emacs-files/sql-private.el
  ~/private-files/emacs-files/slack-private.el
  
  #+end_src  
* Testing
  To run tests we use [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup/][buttercup]] and [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]].

  In the root of this project:
  
*** To install buttercup dependencies
    #+begin_src shell
      $ cask install 
    #+end_src

*** To run tests
    #+begin_src shell
      $ cask exec buttercup
    #+end_src
    
*** Important
    - The test files and way it is being tested are being changed, some tests are not working right now
    - This commands runs only the tests in ~test/~ dir, the personal libs tests have their own
